                    Mcleodganj or Little Lhasa is another well-preserved
                    treasure of Himachal Pradesh and a suburb of Dharamshala.
                    Being the headquarters of the Tibetan government in exile,
                    it is a town with great religious, political and
                    humanitarian significance. But more importantly, it is one
                    of the most captivating and picturesque hill stations in
                    India. Mcleodganj is astoundingly beautiful, with an dense
                    greenery enveloped by the awe-inspiring high peaks of the

                    The mountain town is just 5 km from Dharamshala town, but it
                    is at a considerably higher altitude than the latter. It is
                    a place of considerable religious significance, but also
                    known as a dynamic center of Tibetan culture.
